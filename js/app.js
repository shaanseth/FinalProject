Try reverse psychology. Tell your boss HE'S fired!", "Remember it's better to live one day as a lion than 100 years a sheep. What does that mean? I don't know!

Although one time, Donald Trump asked a better question than me. He asked 'Why can't we use nuclear weapons?' It's true! (Donald Trump, reportedly asking a foreign policy adviser three times during a meeting why the U.S. couldnâ€™t use its nuclear weapons stockpile, according to MSNBC)", "The truth is the enemy. What do we know? All we know is what's on the internet. Also take it from me no one cares about your taxes so chill out already.", "Boring! Repeat after me - the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.", "Be patient!

He is so good with these computers. It's unbelievable. I'll ask him about the clouds and I'll get back to you.", "Repeat after me - I will be so good at the (insert as necessary) your head will spin.", "Pfft fake it. Repeat after me - nobody understand the economy like I do. No one will get the economy more than me. No one can do more for the economy than me. I will be the best understanderer of the economy there is.", "Small potatoes. Borrow a direct quote from a hero - Sorry losers and haters but my IQ is one of the highest and all of you know it.
